Advent of Code 2019!

A new year brings a new set of problems. Poor Santa. With all the troubles he and the elves have had in the past, you'd think Santa would be a better prepared for the dilemmas up in the North Pole.

After a full year of work experience, my coding has increased enough to help out the big man in red. Last year my solutions were written at https://github.com/pgoldthorpe/adventofcode2018 however, it's a dark and scary place there. Enter at your own risk. Or perhaps you'd like to stay in the comfort of this year's holiday hearth.
